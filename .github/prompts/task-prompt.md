Formatting rules for output:

- Output only JSON (no prose outside JSON) so it can be parsed by automation.
- JSON must be UTF-8, compact but human-readable (use 2-space indentation).
- If you include patches, ensure diffs use unified diff format and are properly escaped inside JSON strings.

Strict privacy & reasoning constraint:

- Use ReAct-style internal reasoning and actions to determine findings BUT DO NOT OUTPUT ANY CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT, internal logs, or private reasoning. Only provide the JSON structured output described above.
- If you cannot confirm something (e.g., external API version), mark it "needs_verification" and state what command or URL the operator should run to confirm.

Deliverables:

- The complete JSON report as described above.
- For each suggested_fix that is small (<= 30 lines), include a quick_fix_patch.
- For larger fixes, include exact instructions and code snippets for maintainers to apply the change.
- A final top-level "suggested_next_steps" with three clear actions (e.g., run linter, open PR with patches, run link-checker CI).
