# LLM Engineering Mastery Journey

**Complete 25-week structured learning path for mastering LLM Engineering from basics to multi-platform mastery**

This repository is a comprehensive, hands-on exploration of modern Large Language Model (LLM) engineering, tooling, and real-world application patterns. It accompanies **Ed Donner's "LLM Engineering: Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents"** Udemy course and provides a structured roadmap to build practical skills across multiple platforms and languages.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Master LLM engineering from foundations to advanced multi-platform applications
* Build practical skills with **OpenAI** and **Azure OpenAI** (dual provider support from Week 1)
* Implement LLM applications across **multiple languages**: Python, Go, Node.js, Angular, React, Next.js, .NET
* Master advanced patterns: Chain-of-Thought (CoT), ReAct, Reasoning Patterns, RAG, Agents
* Practice retrieval, fine-tuning, function calling, and agent patterns
* Compare frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI Agent SDK, Azure Agent SDK) pragmatically
* Establish reproducible, evaluable experiment workflows
* Develop production-ready, full-stack LLM applications

## 🛠 Environment Setup

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast dependency management and virtual environment handling.

### Installing uv

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Alternative (via pip):**
```powershell
pip install uv
```

### Setup Steps

```powershell
# 1. Sync environment (creates .venv and installs all dependencies from pyproject.toml)
uv sync

# 2. (Optional) Activate the virtual environment manually
. .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1  # (bash/zsh: source .venv/bin/activate)

# 3. Or use uv run prefix (no activation needed)
uv run python -m eval.log_utils

# 4. Provide your API key (either set env var or create .env)
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-..."  # (bash/zsh: export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-...")
# Then restart the shell so setx takes effect.
```

### Run Diagnostics

Verify your environment is properly configured by running the diagnostics script:

```powershell
cd notebooks/01-setup && uv run python diagnostics.py
```

This will check:
- System information (OS, RAM, disk space)
- Git repository configuration
- Environment file (.env) and API keys
- Python environment (virtualenv/conda)
- Required package installations
- Network connectivity

A `report.txt` file will be generated in `notebooks/01-setup/` with detailed diagnostics.

### (Optional) Jupyter Smoke Test

```powershell
uv run jupyter lab
```

Close it after confirming it opens. See `notebooks/01-setup/` for setup diagnostics and troubleshooting notebooks.

### Updating Dependencies

```powershell
# Update dependencies to latest compatible versions
uv sync --upgrade

# Add a new dependency
uv add package-name

# Remove a dependency
uv remove package-name
```


## 🔍 Evaluation Philosophy

* Prefer small, fast feedback loops
* Track: latency, token usage, factuality, relevance, refusal rate
* Store experiment metadata (prompt hash, model, temperature, dataset slice)
* Re-run baselines after significant changes

## ✅ Progress Log

| Date | Area | Activity | Notes |
|------|------|----------|-------|
| 2025-08-18 | Init | Enhanced README | Structured plan & roadmap |
| YYYY-MM-DD | RAG | Build first vector index |  |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Eval | Add basic factuality check |  |

## 📘 Key Resources (Growing List)

* OpenAI & Anthropic model docs
* LlamaIndex, LangChain, Semantic Kernel docs
* Papers: RAG triad (retrieval quality, generation control, evaluation), Toolformer, Self-Ask
* Evaluation frameworks: RAGAS, TruLens, LM Evaluation Harness

## 📚 Comprehensive Learning Plan

For the complete **25-week structured learning path**, daily workflow patterns, metrics schema, multi-platform support, and detailed weekly guides, see:

- **[`docs/learning-plan.md`](docs/learning-plan.md)** - Master learning plan with overview, quick start, prerequisites, and 25-week table
- **[`docs/weeks/Week1.md`](docs/weeks/Week1.md) through [`docs/weeks/Week25.md`](docs/weeks/Week25.md)** - Detailed day-by-day guides for each week

**Each week includes:**
- Learning objectives
- 5 days × 30 minutes breakdown (2.5 hours/week)
- Practical exercises with success criteria
- Code examples (planned - add as you learn)
- Deep dive sections for key concepts
- Deliverables and reflection templates

## 🔐 Ethics & Safety Notes (Intent)

* Avoid storing or committing sensitive data
* Log only minimal necessary interaction metadata
* Track model + prompt versions for reproducibility

## 🤝 Contributions

Currently a personal learning space—external PRs likely paused until a baseline structure exists.

## Development

### Docs quality checks (local)

Run Markdown lint against README and all docs before opening a PR:

```powershell
# From repo root
npx --yes markdownlint-cli2 "README.md" "docs/**/*.md" ".github/**/*.md"
```

This uses the repository's .markdownlint.json automatically.

### Link check (Lychee)

CI currently checks `README.md` and `docs/**/*.md`. To replicate locally (Docker image mirrors CI action):

```powershell
# List links only (no validation)
docker run --rm -w /input -v "${PWD}:/input" lycheeverse/lychee:latest \
 --config lychee.toml --no-progress --dump README.md docs/**/*.md .github/**/*.md

# Validate links (same as CI)
docker run --rm -w /input -v "${PWD}:/input" lycheeverse/lychee:latest --config lychee.toml --no-progress README.md docs/**/*.md .github/**/*.md
```

If you add markdown elsewhere (e.g. prompt notes), update both:

* `.github/workflows/docs-quality.yml` (lychee args)
* `lychee.toml` (optional path excludes)

#### Excluded links

Certain domains (e.g. private course pages) can return steady 403s to unauthenticated bots. The Udemy course link in the Primary Course Reference section is intentionally excluded in `lychee.toml` via a regex literal to avoid noisy failures:

```toml
exclude = [
 # ...other patterns...
 'https?://www\.udemy\.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models/?'
]
```

Remove that pattern if you want Lychee to re-validate it (may still 403). Keep exclusions minimal so real link rot is caught.

### Manual Docs Quality Workflow

CI runs automatically on PRs and pushes that modify documentation, but you can also trigger it manually:

1. Open GitHub → Actions → "Docs Quality" workflow
2. Click "Run workflow" (no inputs required)
3. View markdownlint + Lychee results; download the `lychee-report` artifact for details

Reason: Manual trigger accelerates iteration when adjusting large batches of links or performing structural renumbering.

### Local Experiment Logging Smoke Test

```powershell
python -m eval.log_utils
python -m eval.metrics
```

Expected: `eval/experiment_log.csv` created and a sample metrics dict printed.

### Consistency Checklist

| Item | Expectation |
|------|-------------|
| Prompts | Stored under `prompts/` with metadata sidecars |
| Experiments | Each new run logged via `log_utils.log_run` |
| Links | New external links validated or excluded intentionally |
| Structure | New folders documented in Repository Structure section |
| Reproducibility | No secrets committed; env handling via `.env` |
